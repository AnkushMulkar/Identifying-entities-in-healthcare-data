# Project Name
> Identifying entities in Healthcare data
You need to process and modify the data into sentence format. This step has to be done for the 'train_sent' and ‘train_label’ datasets and for test datasets as well.
After that, you need to define the features to build the CRF model.
Then, you need to apply these features in each sentence of the train and the test dataset to get the feature values.
Once the features are computed, you need to define the target variable and then build the CRF model.
Then, you need to perform the evaluation using a test data set.
After that, you need to create a dictionary in which diseases are keys and treatments are values.

## General Information
- There are eight major tasks that you need to perform to complete the assignment. They are as follows:

Data preprocessing,
Concept identification,
Defining the features for CRF,
Getting the features words and sentences,
Defining input and target variables,
Building the model,
Evaluating the model,
Identifying the diseases and predicted treatment using a custom NER,
Let's break down the steps into subtasks to understand this better.
